      <description>I was hitting a roadblock trying to get a sites metatags nice for social sharing, using the Metatags module. In the past I&amp;rsquo;ve written code to manually generate the meta tags, but thought this time around I would see if I could not reinvent the wheel.
I started to regret my decision when it seemed like tokens for images don&amp;rsquo;t allow you to serve up derivative images using Image styles. This meant that the only option was to present the image that was uploaded in the raw form - not always what you want.</description>
